h1. Express vhost middleware example

This is a quick and dirty example about how to have more than one domain (or subdomain) served by a single "express":http://expressjs.com/ server, not a complete how-to. 

h2. Run the example

Prerequisite: add localone and localtwo domains to your /etc/hosts.

<pre><code>
cd express-multi-domains
cd localone
npm install
cd ../localtwo
npm install
cd ..
npm install
node server.js
</code></pre>

_Note: of course (sub)domains files should be located somewhere else, this is just for example sake_

Now domains are accessible through localone:8000 and localtwo:8000.
